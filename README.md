## About

<img src="./src/images/motion-full-gif.gif"/>

**Motion Sneakers** is an online store for selling sneakers. The project is built with React and fetches data through a Node API. Users can sign up and make purchases. The project is non-commercial in nature.


## Tools

- JavaScript
- React.js
- CSS (Styled Components)
- Node.js (Express.js)
- MongoDB

## Goals

The first part involved building an API using Express.js, defining models and routes, and implementing authentication. On the front end, React was used, and the main challenges included creating filters with extensive array manipulation, utilizing React context, and correctly passing props throughout the application. ESLint and Prettier were applied for code formatting.

The website is responsive for mobile devices, with some simple layout modifications. Users are required to register (in a simplified manner) in order to make purchases. All artwork was created using Midjourney.
